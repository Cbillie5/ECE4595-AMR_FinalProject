# ECE4595-AMR_FinalProject
For my Autonomous Mobile Robots class at UNM in Spring 2025. I created a simulation with Boids model and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

- pygame_sim_noRL.py is a single run without any of the other scripts and simulates Boid behavior along with the predator and drones

- with pygame_sim.py it should be ran in this order with scripts.
- drone_defense_env -> reward_logger -> train_drone_defense ->plot rewards -> pygame_sim
